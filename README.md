# 🚲 Smart City Bike Sharing Analysis (Power BI)

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **Smart City Bike Sharing data** to evaluate station performance, bike availability, and utilization across multiple cities. Power BI is used to transform raw data into interactive dashboards for actionable urban mobility insights.

## 🎯 Objective
- Analyze bike availability and station utilization  
- Identify demand-supply imbalances across cities and time  
- Support better bike redistribution and planning decisions  

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Power BI  
- Power Query  
- DAX  
- Data Modeling  

## 📊 Key Analysis
- Station availability status (Available / Empty / Full)  
- Utilization rate per station  
- City-wise and time-based availability trends  

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Overall bike availability is sufficient, but unevenly distributed  
- Some stations are overutilized while others are underused  
- Demand varies by time and region, causing peak-hour shortages  

## ✅ Conclusion
Improved bike rebalancing and demand planning can enhance operational efficiency and user satisfaction. This project demonstrates effective use of **Power BI for data-driven urban mobility analysis**.
